/*
Questions:
Are all numbers positive or are there negatives?
Are there duplicates in the array?
Will there always be a solution? If not, what should we return?
Can there be multiple pairs that add up to target value?

Approach:
  Test Cases
    [1,3,7,9,2], target = 11, answer= [3,4]
    [1,3,7,9,2], target = 25, answer= null
    [], target=1, answer=null
    [4], target=1, answer=null
    [1,6], target=7, answer=[0,1]

  Pseudocode: Figure it out prior to coding
