/*
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

There are MULTIPLE ways to do this: sorting, min-heap, max-heap, quicksort, etc.

var kClosest = function (points, k) {

			Math.sqrt(a[0] ** 2 + a[1] ** 2) - Math.sqrt(b[0] ** 2 + b[1] ** 2)
