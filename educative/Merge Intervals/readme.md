# Merge Intervals

This technique revolves around dealing with overlapping intervals. Given two intervals 'a' and 'b', they related to each other in one of six ways:

- don't overlap, 'a' before 'b'
- don't overlap, 'a' after 'b'
- do overlap, 'b' ends after 'a'
- do overlap, 'a' ends after 'b'
- 'a' completely overlaps 'b'
- 'b' completely overlaps 'a'
