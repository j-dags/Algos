# Two Heaps

In many problems, where we are given a set of elements uch that we can divide them into two parts. To solve the problem, we are interested in knowing the smallest element in one part and the biggest element in the other. This pattern uses two Heaps to solve theses problems: a min heap and a max heap.

## Heap

A heap is a special tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.

Max-Heap: The value of the root node is greater than all of its children. The same is true for all sub-trees.
Min-Heap: The value of the root node is smaller than all of its children. THe same is true for all sub-trees.
