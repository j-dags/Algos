# Trees Breadth First Search

Any problem involving the traversal of a tree in a level-by-level order can be efficiently solved using this approach. We will use a queue to keep track of all the nodes before jumping to the next level. Space complexity will always be O(w) where w is the max width of any level of the trees.
