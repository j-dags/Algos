Tech interviews

Test more for problem solving than theoretical knowledge. Conceptually, it's more logic based. In theory you could answer it without really knowing too much about CS.

System Designs Interview

- Cannot be solved without CS understanding. Require knowledge about systems. Robust, scaleable systems.
- Need design fundamentals
- Questions are intentionally very vague. It's interviewees job to take a vague question and turn it into a 45min question.
- A lot more subjectivity to Systems Designs questions.
