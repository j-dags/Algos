Latency

- the time it takes for an operation to complete in a system, typically in time duration like ms or seconds.

Common latency (focus on orders of magnitude):

- Read 1MB from RAM: 250 microseconds (.25ms)
- Read 1MB from SSD: 1000 microseconds (1ms)
- Transfer 1MB over network: 10,000 microseconds (10ms)
- Reading 1MB from HDD: 20,000 microseconds (20ms)
- Inter-Continental Round Trip: 150,000 microseconds (150ms) (California to Netherlands and back)

Throughput

- Number of operations a system can handle properly in a unit of time.
- RPS: requests per second
- Gigabit/s: 1 billion bits per second

How to I increase/optimize throughput?

- simple solution: pay for more. Pay google domains or ISP

Latency and throughput are not necessarily correlated. Can have a low latency, low throughput system.
